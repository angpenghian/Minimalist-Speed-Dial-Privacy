This extension (“Minimalist Speed Dial - New Tab Shortcuts”) helps you create and manage shortcut tiles on your Chrome New Tab page.

## Data this extension stores
- Shortcut titles and URLs you add/edit
- Your shortcut grid settings (e.g., number of shortcuts)

This data is stored using Chrome’s extension storage. If you have Chrome Sync enabled, Chrome may sync this data across your signed-in devices.

## Data this extension does not collect
This extension does not:
- Collect personal information (name, email, address)
- Collect passwords or payment information
- Track your browsing history
- Sell or share your data with third parties

## Network requests
To display shortcut icons, the extension may request website favicons (icons) from public favicon endpoints. Search queries are sent only when you submit a search, using your chosen search engine.

## Data retention and deletion
